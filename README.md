## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Option 1: Run the Standalone .exe File
The .exe version is now available! üéâ You can download it from the [EventScheduler Release](https://github.com/Mahdi767/Event-Scheduler/releases/tag/Event--Scheduler) section.

Run the .exe file directly on your Windows machine without needing to install Java.

**Warning**: Windows may detect the .exe file as potentially malicious. This is a false positive due to the file not being signed. If prompted, you can proceed by allowing the file to run:

1. Click on **More Info**.
2. Click on **Run Anyway** to bypass the warning and run the application.

This is a common issue with files that are not signed or from unknown sources, but rest assured the file is safe to use.

### Option 2: Run the Program via IDE (For Developers)
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the `EventScheduler.java` file from src.

## Usage üöÄ
- Run the program and enter event details like title, description, date, time, and duration.
- Click "Create Event" to add a new event to the list.
- Modify or delete events using the "Modify Event" and "Delete Event" buttons.
- Save events to a .txt or .csv file by clicking the "Save as .txt file" or "Save as .csv file" buttons.
- Events will be displayed in a structured table for easy management.
